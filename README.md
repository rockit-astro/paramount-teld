## SuperWASP upgrade prototype telescope daemon [![Travis CI build status](https://travis-ci.org/warwick-one-metre/rasa-teld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/warwick-one-metre/rasa-teld)

Part of the observatory software for the SuperWASP upgrade prototype

`teld` wraps the Paramount ME TheSkySix telescope control interface with a Pyro daemon that emulates the [W1m teld](https://github.com/warwick-one-metre/teld).

`tel` is a commandline utility for controlling the telescope.

See [Software Infrastructure](https://github.com/warwick-one-metre/docs/wiki/Software-Infrastructure) for an overview of the W1m software architecture and instructions for developing and deploying the code.

### Software setup

Clone the software and run manually on Windows.
